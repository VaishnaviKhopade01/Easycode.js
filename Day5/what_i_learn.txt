Assignment Operators:
    1] = : assignment Operator

    2]Addition assignment operator: +=
        eg.let x=3
        x+=5    //x=x+5

    3]Subtraction assignment operator: -=
        eg.let b=10
        b-=3    //b=b-3

    4]Multiplication assignment operator: *=
        eg.let m=5
        m*=2    //m=m*2
    
    5]Division assignment operator: /=
        eg.let r=6
        r/=2
    
    6]Modulus assignment operator: %=
        eg.let t=12
        t%=2

Comparison Operators: return every time boolean values (TRUE FALSE)

    1]Double equal: (==)
    
    2]Not equal: (!=)

    3]Strictly equal: (===)
        which checks type and also value of variable

    4]Strictly not equal: (!==)

    5]Greater than: (>)

    6]Less than:(<)

    7]Greater than or equal to: (>=)

    8]Less than or equal to: (<=)
