WHILE LOOP:

    while(condition){
        //code
    }

if condition is true then code will execute
code will execute whenever condition is true if condition becomes false it will terminate.
    
    eg.let i=0
        while(i<3){
            console.log(i)
            i++
        }

    Entry control loop



DO-WHILE LOOP:

    do{
        //code
    }while(condition)

firstly statement of code will execute then it will check condition .i.e atleast once  the statement is executed before checking condition.

    Bottom control loop

    eg.
    let i=0
    do{
        console.log(i)
        i++
    }while(i<10)
